# testable

This project is the basis for an workshop on testability and clean code.

The repository contains a small project which lists the github repository and
used languages for the 20 last tweets from the user @TrendingGithub.

The first state of this repository is a quick write up of this app, while
the branches step-1 through step-6 contains small tasks to refactor the code.

Proposed solutions are given in the branches solution-1 through solution-6.
